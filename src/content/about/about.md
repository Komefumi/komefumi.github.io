## Welcome to my Blog

You can call me by multiple names. My current chosen name within the Github space is `Komefumi`, and it's very special to me. `Arjun` is my name in real life, and it's very important. As well as another chosen name, `Hafiz`. For me, names are quite relevant.

In this blog I wish to share my thoughts, and useful insights from my journey through programming, succeeding in life in a spiritual and meaningful way, as well as any sentiments I might wish to share. One thing I hope to do is to inspire people to become independent and to have what they truly value, through my journey, beginning with my own personal redemption.

This blog will be frequently updated. You can consider this a constant work in progress.

I have made use of [this theme](https://github.com/thiloho/aurora#make-the-theme-yours) for Astro. Note that it makes use of svelte.
