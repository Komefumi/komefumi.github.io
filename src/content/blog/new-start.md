## Orchastrating a Beginning

In certain circles, we have the practice of ascribing meaning to actions. Symbolic movements have their merit. In the grand scheme, with belief and with consistent effort, change in actualized through channels now entirely visible.

With this in mind consider this first blog post symbolic. Not void of meaning - despite how it might seem to the uninitiated, it is full of meaning for me. However the substance is not unnecessarily obscured - at least it is not so in my view. For those who can relate, the substance is to be readily found. Perhaps you will enjoy this post, in which case, you may wish to contact me.

My email is down in the contact section, but in case a `mailto:` link isn't your fancy: `komefumi@protonmail.ch`. I may in the near future establish additional channels of communication. These are to be clearly visible in this blog!

## And now I begin, in vague terms

They say the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. I had begun my first steps when I was born, but, for reasons I will say I had gotten stuck. It was my own fault but at the same time, I do not entirely agree with this. Even if it's a lie, I would like to make it a truth that things that happened were not solely because of me.

However I know that this is not a lie.

Yet I wish to also become strong and redeem myself, and become equivalent to one who would have never lost their way.

## My Journey Begins Anew

I had multiple attempts at making a fresh start. I made headway, but I could not find the will to continue longer.

However, I assert now that I have... found a strong enough reason to let me continue. And melt away my difficulties, and integrate them, and make use of them in my newfound being.

## In Less Abstract Terms

While the entirety of my journey will remain vague for this first post, let me mention in terms that is more palpable. I am a software developer, but I had prevented myself from getting off from a certain stage. This blog post and revamped blog represents the center stage I take in my life from this point.

To begin to create a change in the world by becoming one myself. Start within to create without. This is sufficient. I wish to represent this truth.

## But now in even less abstract terms

Current status: Age 26, unemployed, no college degree, and consistently failing at my job applications. Yet my skill level isn't nil, and this is a resource for me to build upon from. So long as I believe in myself - as I now do.
